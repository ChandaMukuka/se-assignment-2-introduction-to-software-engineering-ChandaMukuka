Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
-Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.Engineering principles and knownledge of programming languages is applied to build software solutions for end users.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
-Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.Engineering principles and knownledge of programming languages is applied to build software solutions for end users.
            DIFFERANCE BETWEEN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING
-Software engineering often follows an iterative development process ,where software is continuously refined and improved based on user feedback while traditional programming disciplines typically follow a more linear process where designs are finalised before contruction begins.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
                          PHASES
-Requirements gathering and analysis is the first stage ,it imvolves the team developing the software discussing ,collecting the neccessary requirements needed eg the hardware ,software, security ,douments etc.
-The second stage is planning and designing ,this stage involves creating a comprehensive project plan that sets timelines ,resources allocation ,creating the software architecture and designs.
-Implementation,this stage involves wrting ,testing,and debugging the software code.And building the software according to the design.
-Testing stage ,this stage involves testing the software to make sure it works well before it is released to end users.This stage helps in identifying problems and resolving them early to meet the needs of users.
-Deployment stage,in this stage the software is released to users .
-Maintainance stage ,in this stage the developers of the software provide ongoing support and updates the customers.And also adressing their quires or concerns .
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
                     AGILE VS WATERFALL
-Agile is an incremental approach to software development that prioritizes flexibility and collaborations,you can start with any stage you want and move on to the next without any problem  while  Waterfall model ia a linear and squential approach to software development .With this model each phase occurs in a strict order,progress can only be made after the previous one is complete.
-Agile is flexible to use and can adapt to change whiele waterfall model is challenging to adapt to changing requirment.
-Agile can be used in projects that have dynamic requirements ,need frequent client feedback and values adaptability while waterfall model can be used in projects with well defined requirements ,limited client involvement during development.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
-Requirement engineering is the process of defining ,documenting and maintaining requirements of stakeholders to meet their needs.
                 PROCESSES
-This process involves feasibility  ,requirements elicitation requirement specification ,requirement for verification and validation,and requirements management.
                   IMPORTANCE
-It is important because it helps to ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectatons of the stakeholders and also identify potential issues or problems early in the development process .
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-Modularity refers to the design approach that emphasises the separation of concerns ,where a complex software system is divided into smaller ,loosely coupled modules.
-It improves maintainability and scalability by structuring a software system into smaller ,cohesive modules ,the code becomes easier to understand and navigate.And updates and bd fixes can be applied without affecting the entire system.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
                 LEVELS OF TESTING
-Unit testing is done at code level where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
-Integration testing enebles softwarevtesters to test group units integrated into a system or subsystem this helps to identify bugs.
-System tesing is performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application ,where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
-Acceptance testing involves testing the systems functional and and non-functional aspects,such as performance ,security ,compatibility etc.
               WHY TESTING IS CRUCIAL
-It is crucial because it identifies defects and errors that occured during the development phase.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
-Version control systems are systems that track the progress of code across the software the software development lifecycle and its multiple iterations .
            IMPORTANCE
-They are important because it  helps to manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications.
                 EXAMPLES
-Examples include Git which is popular due to its speed and support for distributed workflow.
another one is Mercurial which ia designed to handle projects of any sizeefficienty and quickly.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-A software project manager organizes software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task .
-Their responsibility is to monitor and review projects .
-Reporting project status to the customers and the oraganization .
-Another responsibility is to schedule the completion of  all the project  parametres and scheduling for manpower.
-Challenges they face is poor communication between team members which can lead to poor outcomes and delay project completion.
-Another challenge faced is  resource allocation that can make budgeting and acquiring sufficient resources difficult.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
-Software maintainance is the process of modifying ,changing and updating a software system to resolve errors ,improve performance or adapt to a changing environment.
                        TYPES 
-Corrective which is the process of identifying errors and faults of the application and correcting them.
-Adaptive involves necessary updates and changes.
-Preventative involves detecting and resolving issues early .
-Perfective involves refining and deleting certain functionalities as well as adding new ones.
-it is an essential part because its helps to fix bugs and errors and ensure optimal performance of the software application.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-Unethical data collection is one of the issues software engineers face so make sure customers are aware of what information they are  sharing and how it is going to be used .
-Weak security and 
-To avoid this make sure you are honest ,do not fasely advertise features or exaggerate the performance.
Be proactive ,make sure to address any potential abuse and other ethical issues if any.
